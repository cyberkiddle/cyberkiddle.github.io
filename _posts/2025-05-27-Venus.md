By using the port 8080 running the http-proxy server, finsing the posible users in the system
Using the user guest:guest we can see in the reques there is the vlidation auth exncripted with base64, so lets try to fins the other users in the sys.

## Initial access
i found the vulneurability is in the page '/' that refrect the authentic cypher on the client side req
so i have to use the credentials of the uses i have get and see if i can manage to get the access to the target, so i have to convert the user and the same pass into base64 and find the loocation were there is the out put break in the system.
finslly i get this and it was encoded of user magellan
bWFnZWxsYW46aXJhaGZ2bmF0cmJ5YnRsMTk4OQ==

decrep using base64 and try to identfy the ype of cypher in the user name it was ROT13 then i used the credentials see the picture bellow
